# 🐱 Cat Selector App

A simple web-based application to help users choose a type of cat based on various criteria such as weight, health issues, intelligence, and child-friendliness. This project was created as part of a lab assignment in Web Development 2.

## 📋 Features

- View all available cat breeds (67 total)
- Filter cats by health issues
- Display weight ranges in either Imperial or Metric units
- Show intelligence and child-friendliness ratings
- Calculate:
  - Average intelligence of all cats
  - Average intelligence for cats that are child-friendly (rating = 4)

## 🚀 How It Works

This app fetches data from [The Cat API](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds) and dynamically displays results based on user input and button actions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com)

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. **Download or Clone this repo**
2. Open `cat-selector.html` in any modern browser
3. Ensure you are connected to the internet (for API to load data)
4. Use the buttons and input fields to filter and explore cat breeds

## 📂 File Structure


## 📌 Notes

- The app relies on live data from the API. If the API is down or unavailable, data won't load.
- Child-friendly values are based on the `child_friendly` property in the cat dataset (scale of 1–5).
